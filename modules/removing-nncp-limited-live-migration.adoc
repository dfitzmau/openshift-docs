= Removing the `NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy` (NNCP) custom resource (CR)

The OpenShift SDN plugin allows application of the NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy (NNCP) custom resource (CR) to the primary interface on a node. The OVN-Kubernetes network plugin does not have this capability.

If you have an NNCP applied to the primary interface, you must delete the NNCP before migrating to the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin. Deleting the NNCP does not remove the configuration from the primary interface, but the Kubernetes-NMState cannot manage this configuration. Instead, the `configure-ovs.sh` shell script manages the primary interface and the configuration attached to it.

.Prerequisites

* You created an NNCP CR and applied it to the primary interface of your network.

.Procedure

. Remove the configuration from the Cluster Network Operator (CNO) configuration object by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch Network.operator.openshift.io cluster --type='merge' \ --patch '{"spec":{"migration":null}}'
----

. Delete the `NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy` (NNCP) custom resource (CR) that defines the primary network interface for the OpenShift SDN network plugin by completing the following steps:
+
.. Check that the existing NNCP CR bonded the primary interface to your cluster by entering the following command: 
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get nncp
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME          STATUS      REASON
bondmaster0   Available   SuccessfullyConfigured
----
+
Network Manager stores the connection profile for the bonded primary interface in the `/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections` system path.
+
.. Remove the NNCP from your cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete nncp <nncp_manifest_filename>
----
