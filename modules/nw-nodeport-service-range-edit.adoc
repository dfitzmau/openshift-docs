= Expanding the node port range

You can expand the node port range for your cluster.

[IMPORTANT]
====
After you install your {product-title} cluster, you cannot contract the node port range on either side. If you expanded the range and a port allocation issue occurs, you must create a new cluster and set the required range for it. 
====

.Prerequisites

* Installed the {oc-first}.
* Logged in to the cluster as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.
* You ensured that your cluster infrastructure allows access to the ports that will exist in the extended range. For example, if you expand the node port range to `29000-32900`, your firewall or packet filtering configuration must allow the inclusive port range of `29000-32900`.

.Procedure

* Expand the range for the `serviceNodePortRange` parameter in the `network.config.openshift.io` object that your cluster uses to manage traffic for pods, by entering the following command in your command-line interface (CLI):
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch network.config.openshift.io cluster --type=merge -p \
  '{
    "spec":
      { "serviceNodePortRange": "<port_range>" } <1>
  }'
----
<1> Where `<port_range>` is your expanded range, such as `29000-32900`.
+
[TIP]
====
You can also apply the following YAML to update the node port range:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: Network
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  serviceNodePortRange: "<port_range>"
----
====
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
network.config.openshift.io/cluster patched
----

.Verification

* To confirm a successful configuration, enter the following command. The command can take several minutes for the update to apply.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get configmaps -n openshift-kube-apiserver config \
  -o jsonpath="{.data['config\.yaml']}" | \
  grep -Eo '"service-node-port-range":["[[:digit:]]+-[[:digit:]]+"]'
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
"service-node-port-range":["29000-32900"]
----
