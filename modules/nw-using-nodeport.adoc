= Using a NodePort to get traffic into the cluster

Use a `NodePort`-type `Service` resource to expose a service on a specific port on all nodes in the cluster. The port is specified in the `.spec.ports[*].nodePort` field of the `Service` resource. 

[IMPORTANT]
====
Using a node port requires additional port resources.
====

A `NodePort` exposes the service as a static port on the node's IP address. A `NodePort` service operates in the `30000` to `32767` range by default, which means a `NodePort` is unlikely to match an intended port on a default service. For example, port `8080` might be exposed as port `31020` on the node.

The administrator must ensure the external IP addresses are routed to the nodes. A `NodePort` service and external IP addresses are independent and both can be used concurrently.
