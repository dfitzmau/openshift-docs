= Creating a project and service

If the project and service that you want to expose do not exist, you must create the project and then the service.

If the project and service already exist, go the "Exposing the service by creating a route" procedure.

.Prerequisites

* You installed the {oc-first} and logged in as a cluster administrator.

.Procedure

. Create a new project for your service by entering the following `oc new-project` command in your CLI:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc new-project <service_project_name> <1>
----

. Enter the `oc new-app` command to create your service:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc new-app <service_name>
----

. To patch the created `NodePort` service as a service that selects an available port on each node in your cluster, enter the following command. The command does not require that you define a route, router, or ingress controller for a cluster.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch svc/<service_name> --type='merge' -p='{"spec":{"type":"NodePort"}}' -n <service_project_name>
service/<service_name> patched
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME                     TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                        AGE
<service_project_name>   NodePort    172.30.231.25    <none>        8080:32171/TCP,8888:30515/TCP  7m17s
----

.Verification

. To verify that the new service exists enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get svc -n <service_project_name>
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME                    TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)             AGE
<service_project_name>  ClusterIP   172.30.231.25    <none>        8080/TCP,8888/TCP   6m25s
----
+
By default, the new service does not have an external IP address.
