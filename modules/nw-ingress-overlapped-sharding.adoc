== Overlapped sharding example

In addition to `finops-router` and `dev-router` in the example above, you also have `devops-router`, which is configured with the label selector `spec.namespaceSelector.matchLabels.name` set to `dev` and `ops`:

.Example YAML definition for `devops-router`
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
kind: IngressController
metadata:
  name: devops-router
  namespace: openshift-ingress-operator
spec:
  namespaceSelector:
    matchLabels:
      name:
        - dev
        - ops
----
The routes in the namespaces labeled `name:dev` and `name:ops` are now serviced by two different Ingress Controllers. With this configuration, you have overlapping subsets of routes.

With overlapping subsets of routes you can create more complex routing rules. For example, you can divert higher priority traffic to the dedicated `finops-router` while sending lower priority traffic to `devops-router`.
