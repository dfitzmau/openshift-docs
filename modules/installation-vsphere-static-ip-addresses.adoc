== Static IP addresses for vSphere nodes

You can provision bootstrap, control plane, and compute nodes to use static IP addresses, so that you can better configure your network to meet the security demands of your organization. To configure this environment, you must provide values to the `platform.vsphere.hosts.role` parameter in the `install-config.yaml` file.

:FeatureName: Static IP addresses for vSphere nodes
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

By default, the installation program is configured to use the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) for the network, but this network has limited configurable capabilities.

After you define `controlPlane`, `compute` or both machine pools in your `install-config.yaml` file, you can define network defintions for nodes on your network. Ensure that the number of network definitions match the configured machine pools types.

The following example shows a `compute` network definition specified for the `role` parameter:

[source,yaml]
----
---
platform:
  vsphere:
    hosts:
    - role: compute <1>
    networkDevice:
      ipAddrs:
      - 192.168.204.10/24 <2>
      gateway: 192.168.204.1 <3>
      nameservers:
      - 192.168.204.1 <4>
---
----
<1> Valid network defintion values include `bootstrap`, control-plane`, and `compute`. You must list at least one `bootstrap` network definition.
<2> Lists IPv4, IPv6, or both IP addresses that installation program passes to the network interface. Both IP families must use the same network interface for the default network. 
<3> The default gateway for the network interface. 
<4> Lists up to 3 DNS servers that can resolve provided provided IP addresses by a process known as DNS resolution.

[IMPORTANT]
====
To enable the Technology Preview feature of static IP addresses for vSphere nodes for your cluster, you must include `featureSet:TechPreviewNoUpgrade` as the initial entry in the `install-config.yaml` file.
====

After you deployed your cluster to run nodes with static IP addresses, you can scale a machine to use one of these static IP addresses. Additionally, you can use a machine set to configure a machine with one one of the static IP addresses
