[id="Jira-OCPBUGS-13244"]
Cause: WMCO fails to configure Windows Server 2019 instances on Azure that do not have the Containers feature pre-installed with "Install-WindowsFeature : Win32 internal error "Access is denied" 0x5
occurred while reading the console output buffer". This happens because the command results in a progress bar being displayed and that cannot
be displayed over ssh and results in the error. 

Consequence: VM never get configured into a node

Fix: Fix this by silencing progress bar.

Result: VM gets configured into a node
