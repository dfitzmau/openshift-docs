{product-title} provides methods for communicating from outside the cluster with services running in the cluster. The method outlined in this document describes manually setting your own ports for your load balancer that runs on supported cloud-based infrastructure.

// Using a load balancer to get traffic into a cluster

== Prerequisites

Before starting the following procedures, the administrator must complete the following tasks:

* Set up the external port to the cluster networking environment so that requests can reach the cluster.

* Ensure you have at least one user with cluster admin role. To add this role to a user, run the following command:
+
----
$ oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user cluster-admin username
----

* Ensure your {product-title} cluster has at least one control plane node and one node, and a system outside the cluster that has network access to the cluster. This procedure assumes that the external system is on the same subnet as the cluster. The additional networking required for external systems on a different subnet is out-of-scope for this document.
