toc::[]

During cluster installation, you can set the node port range to whatever range meets the needs of your cluster. As a postinstallation task, you can expand the available node port range. A cluster administrator can only expand the range. If your cluster uses of a large number of node ports, consider increasing the number of available ports.

If you did not set a node port range during cluster installation, the default range of `30000-32767` applies to your cluster. In this situation, you can extend the range on either side but you must preserve `30000-32767` within your new port range.

Expanding the node port range for a cluster is not limited to a one-time-only operation. If you need to re-expand the node port range, include the previous expanded range in the newly expanded port range so that control planes do not experience port allocation issues.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Ensure that the new port range does not conflict with a port that is already assigned to a process on a host or a pod configured for host networking.
