You can install an {product-title} cluster on {oci}, so that you can run cluster workloads on infrastructure that supports dedicated, hybrid, public, and multiple cloud environments. Both Red Hat and {oracle} test, validate, and support running {oci-short} and {ocvs} workloads in an {product-title} cluster on {oci}.

{oci-short} provides services that can meet your regulatory compliance, performance, and cost-effectiveness needs. Additionally, {oci-short} provides an {ocvs} service where you can move VMware workloads to {oci-short} with minimal application re-architecture.

By running your {product-title} cluster on {oci}, you can access the following capabilities:

* Compute flexible shapes, where you can customize the number of {oracle} CPUs (OCPUs) and memory resources for your virtual machine (VM). With access to this capability, a cluster's workload can perform operations in a resource-balanced environment. You can find all {op-system-base}-certifed {oci} shapes by going to the link:https://catalog.redhat.com/cloud/detail/216977[*Oracle*] page on the Red Hat Ecosystem Catalog portal.
* Bare metal shapes, where you can run cluster workloads under high-performance conditions on infrastructure that supports configuring advanced basic input/output system (BIOS) settings. 
* Block Volume storage, where you can configure scaling and auto-tuning settings for your storage volume, so that the Block Volume service automatically adjusts the performance level to optimize performance.
* OCVS, where you can deploy a cluster in a public-cloud environment that operates on a VMware vSphere software-defined data center (SDDC). You continue to retain full-adminsitrative control over your VMware vSphere environment, but you can use {oci} services to improve your applications on flexible, scalable, and secure infrastructure.

[IMPORTANT]
====
To ensure the best performance conditions for your cluster workloads that operate in the OCVS service, select 30 or more volume performance units (VPUs) for your block volume.
====

Red Hat supports the following {oci-short} installation methods: 

* Using the Assisted Installer to install an {product-title} cluster on {oci-short}
** Installing an {product-title} cluster on {oci-short} Bare Metal - Relates to AI
* Using VMs to install an {product-title} cluster on {oci-short} - unsupported for 4.14, but migth make 4.15
* Using the Agent-based installer to install an {product-title} cluster on {oci-short} - my focus
