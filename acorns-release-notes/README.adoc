== File descriptions

The `acorns-release-notes` directory stores configuration files for a release notes documentation project. The file uses the aCoRNs tool to generate release notes from Bugzilla, if used, and Jira tickets.

* The `release-notes.adoc` file is the main, entry-point AsciiDoc file. The file includes both generated and manually written content. The file compiles as an external version of the document, suitable for publication.

* The `internal.adoc` file is a wrapper around ``release-notes.adoc`. The file enables you to select an internal preview of the documentation, rather than the default external version.

* The `manual-content/` directory contains manually written AsciiDoc content that you can include from the release-notes.adoc file.

* The `acorns/` directory contains generator configuration files and generated AsciiDoc content that you can include from the release-notes.adoc file:

`acorns/tickets.yaml`::
Lists the tickets and ticket queries that populate your release notes.

`acorns/tracker.yaml`::
Configures access to your Bugzilla and Jira instance.

`acorns/templates.yaml`::
Configures how your tickets are organized into sections of the document.

`acorns/generated/external/` and `acorns/generated/internal/`::
Store the generated assemblies and modules. These directories strictly contain only generated content, and the directories appear when aCoRNs has generated documentation files.
+
At every run, aCoRNs removes and recreates these files. Do not save manual content here.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Check that the ``release-notes` contains an entry for `:generated-dir: acorns/generated/external`. The `acorns` file path should not state `corn` or any other variants. If you do not ensure this then you will be prompted with an error such as:

`ERROR: `release-notes: line 28: include file not found: /home/dfitzmau/git/openshift-docs/release_notes_acorn/cizrna/generated/external/external/assembly_bug-fixes.adoc`
====

// Future considerations: filter out internal security bug Jiras and introduce known issue and enhancement bugs solely from the OpenShift Bugs project.
