== Introduction

The IBM Power Virtual Server Block CSI Driver will be installed through IBM Power Virtual Server Block CSI Driver Operator and the operator is based on libarary-go. The OpenShift library-go is a collection of functions that allow us to build OpenShift operators easily. Most of the functionality of a CSI driver operator is already available there. The IBM Power Virtual Server Block CSI Driver Operator is installed by the cluster-storage-operator. The Cluster-storage-operator installs the IBM Power Virtual Server Block CSI Driver Operator if the Platform type is Power Virtual Servers.

== Overview

{product-title} can provision persistent volumes (PVs) by using the Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver for {iibm-cloud-bm-reg} Virtual Server Block Storage.

Familiarity with xref:../../storage/understanding-persistent-storage.adoc#understanding-persistent-storage[persistent storage] and xref:../../storage/container_storage_interface/persistent-storage-csi.adoc#persistent-storage-csi[configuring CSI volumes] is helpful when working with a CSI Operator and driver.

To create CSI-provisioned PVs that mount to {iibm-cloud-bm-reg} Virtual Server Block storage assets, {product-title} installs the {iibm-cloud-bm-reg} Virtual Server Block CSI Driver Operator and the {iibm-cloud-bm-reg} Virtual Server Block CSI driver by default in the `openshift-cluster-csi-drivers` namespace.

* The _{iibm-cloud-bm-reg} Virtual Server Block CSI Driver Operator_ provides two storage classes named `ibm-power-regvs-tier1` (default), and `ibm-power-regvs-tier3` for different tiers that you can use to create persistent volume claims (PVCs). The {iibm-cloud-bm-reg} Virtual Server Block CSI Driver Operator supports dynamic volume provisioning by allowing storage volumes to be created on demand, eliminating the need for cluster administrators to pre-provision storage.

* The _{iibm-cloud-bm-reg} Virtual Server Block CSI driver_ allows you to create and mount {iibm-cloud-bm-reg} Virtual Server Block PVs.
